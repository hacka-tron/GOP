# Getting Started
Beyond the standard setup of downloading Node and the various dependencies, this Node server has a couple more requirements to get started.

1. Add any videos you want to use to the src/videos directory.
2. Update the environment variables (.env) to inclue the binary path for ffmpeg. 

And that's it!
